# Uploading scripts and fonts to HubSpot CDN 

This is a short and simple tutorial on how you can go about HubSpot's file manager and CND for javascripts and web fonts. 

### Step 01
In your HubSpot portal, navigate to the top menu: Content - File Manager

### Step 02
Ideally it would be nice to create a folder for your fonts or scripts. I would create a "js" folder or a "fonts" folder depending on what I will be uploading. Add your files to the desired folder and please keep a clean structure. 

### Step 03
Once uploaded you will need to get a url which you will need to add to your design manager's portal. To get the CDN link click on the cock screw image as follows, the copy the url:

```html
http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/165931/file-218958104-js/js/cbpAnimatedHeader.min.js
```

### Step 04
You can then copy and paste the CDN url where you would like to use it in your portal. You can use the same method to upload fonts, css, javascripts, etc
